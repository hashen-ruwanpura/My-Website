# GitHub Pages Direct Deployment Guide

## Problem
The GitHub Pages deployment is not working correctly with the current GitHub Actions workflow.

## Solution
We'll switch to deploying directly from a branch.

## Steps to Fix

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**:
   - Navigate to https://github.com/hashen-ruwanpura/My-Website

2. **Open Repository Settings**:
   - Click on "Settings" tab
   - Select "Pages" from the left sidebar

3. **Change Deployment Source**:
   - Under "Build and deployment" section, change source from "GitHub Actions" to "Deploy from a branch"
   - For the branch, select "main" and folder "/ (root)"
   - Click "Save"

4. **Wait for Deployment**:
   - GitHub will start deploying your site from the main branch
   - This will use the `simple-index.html` file we added

5. **Test Your Website**:
   - After deployment completes, visit `https://hashenruwanpura.com`
   - You should see the simple HTML page we created

## If Issue Persists
If you're still seeing a 404 error after these changes:

1. **Try accessing the GitHub Pages URL directly**:
   - https://hashen-ruwanpura.github.io/My-Website/

2. **Check your Custom Domain settings**:
   - Make sure the custom domain in GitHub Pages settings exactly matches your DNS records

3. **Contact GitHub Support**:
   - If issues persist, GitHub Support can help with GitHub Pages-specific problems

## Next Steps for Full Website Deployment
Once this is working, we can focus on properly building and deploying your React application.
